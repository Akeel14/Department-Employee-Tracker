        <p> 
          The web application is a tool for managing information about the different departments and employees in an organization. It allows users to                 create, read, update, and delete records for both departments and employees.
        </p>

        <p>
          The application uses MongoDB to store the information about departments and employees, and uses Handlebars templates to render the user interface           in the web browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the key features of the web application is that it allows users to create an account, which allows them to access additional features such           as the ability to add images to their records and view their login history. This makes the application more personalized and user-friendly.
       </p>

        <p>
          The application follows RESTful API design principles, which means that it exposes a set of endpoints that allow users to perform CRUD (create,             read, update, delete) operations on department and employee records. This makes the application easy to use and allows it to be easily integrated           with other systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, the web application provides a simple and intuitive way for organizations to manage information about their departments and employees.             It uses MongoDB and Handlebars to ensure that the data is stored and accessed efficiently, and provides a user-friendly interface for working               with that data. Users can create an account to access additional features and personalize their experience.
